# findapet

<h2>Project Summary: </h2>
Findapet is a web application that allows people to find a dog or a cat to adopt, or post a pet for adoption. 

<h2>Motivation: </h2>
After learning database design and modeling, I decided to get started with back end development. I chose to start with learning Java Servlets and JSP. This allows me to understand HTTP requests, and explore further topics like session management, servlet filtering, caching, security configuration, and application deployment. Since i am a pet lover, I chose my application to be about pet adoption.
